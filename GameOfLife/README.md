[Conway's Game of Life](https://robertheaton.com/2018/07/20/project-2-game-of-life/): The classic cellular automaton! 
A system of cells that live on a grid, where they live, die and evolve according to the rules that govern their world!! 
Life’s simple, elegant rules give rise to astonishingly complex emergent behavior. 
It is played on a 2-D grid. Each square in the grid contains a cell, and each cell starts the game as either “alive” or “dead”.
