# PNGme: An Intermediate Rust Project
[PNGme](https://picklenerd.github.io/pngme_book/): This project only gives unit tests and relevant reading material to create a CLI PNG hidden message encoder/decoder that sneaks in and reads hidden chunks from the PNG. PNGs are made up of chunks, similar to legos, that each have labels that tell the image creating process what to do with itself. Well you can insert a chunk with a label that allows it to be ignored during the image creation process, that is where we slip it in! A hidden lego! Made using this [PNG file structure inspec](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/spec/1.2/PNG-Structure.html)
