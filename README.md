# Rust learning!

Hi! This is where I'm keeping track of what and how I'm learning Rust! The first section are my learning materials with each subsequent section the chapters and the date of completion. 

# Materials

- [✨The Book✨](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) is the official Rust Programming Language book that is installed with rust! `rustup doc`
- [PNGme: An Intermediate Rust Project](https://picklenerd.github.io/pngme_book/): This project only gives unit tests and relevant reading material to create a CLI PNG hidden message encoder/decoder
- **NOTE: As of 10/4/22 I have decided to pivot from cryptopals.. While the challenges are thought provoking and enjoyable, I am spending more time learning about modern day cryptographic constructs than RUST, which was the goal of this repo! I will come back to conquer, but must stay on course**
- [Cryptopals Crypto Challenges](https://cryptopals.com/) are a series of coding challenge sets that are derived from weaknesses in real world systems and modern cryptographic constructions.
- [Leetcode account](https://leetcode.com/TylerGates/)
